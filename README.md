# RaceTrack
Angular / Java / Jakarta EE application to keep track of all Motorsport Events.

The goal of Race Track is to easily keep track of what race series are racing next and when and where to watch the different sessions. RaceTrack makes it easy to make your own schedule so you never miss a Race Event.

This application was made as a practice project to practice making a Java/Jakarta backend with an Angular frontend for my studies.
