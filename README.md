# race-track
Angular / java application to keep track of all those different race series to watch

The goal of Race Track is to easily keep track of what race series are racing next and when and where to watch the different sessions. Eventually the user should be able to add their own favorite series and maybe even import existing schedules from different resources.

This application was partly made as a practice project to practice making a Java backend with a Angular frontend.
